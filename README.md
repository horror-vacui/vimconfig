I just want to push my vim config into the "cloud", so I can have the same config and the same plugins in all computer. 

The sinple `git clone` will not download the submodule contents, it requries the `--recursive` switch to do that.
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:horror-vacui/vimconfig.git ~/.vim/`
